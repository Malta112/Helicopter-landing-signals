# Helicopter-landing-signals
Its a scipt for Fivem written in Lua. Its to signal a helicopter where it can land.

It uses a Command to spawn the Signals.
I decided not to get the Z Value for the Position by the ground because when the ground is uneven the heli 
should land here.
You can configure the Command,the Job (If somebody needs a job to use the command), If the JOblock should be disabled,
you can configure the prop that is in use and the time that the flare should be visible.
